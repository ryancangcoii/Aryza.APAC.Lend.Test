Test Exercise 2
If you have completed the first test exercise, you can continue with the second one.
Modify the program and the FinancialSystem.DescribeAllAccounts() method so that each account provides a detailed description of itself. This description should include:

The type of account
Its balance
Its interest rate (if applicable)
Accounts that do not earn interest (e.g. OffsetAccount) should clearly state that they are non-interest-bearing and should not include an InterestRate field.
